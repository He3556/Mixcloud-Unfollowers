### This tool compares 2 lists: 
1. your followers 
2. people you follow 
and filters out the DJs, that are not folling you (anymore), while you still follow them. 
You will wonder how many people (promoters/bots) unfollowed. 
They might do it for a better quota - have more followers than following others - i don't know...  

#### long-term development: How to indentify bots on Mixcloud?

#### jQuery mobile framework 
The view is not really optimized for small displays but you can use it on a smartphone.
