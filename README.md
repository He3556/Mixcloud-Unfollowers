### This tool compares 2 lists: 
1. your followers 
2. people you follow 

It filters out the DJs, that are not folling you back (anymore), while you still follow them. 
You will wonder how many people (promoters/bots) unfollowed. 
They might do it for a better quota - have more followers than following others - i don't really know...  

#### for long-term development: I want to indentify bots and fakers on Mixcloud.

#### jQuery mobile framework 
The view is not really optimized for small displays but you can use it on a smartphone.
