This tool compares your followers with the people you are following.  
You will wonder how many people stopped following you. 
If they do it for a better proportion - so they have more followers than ppl following or maybe there is another reason? 
Mixcloud bots would do the same i guess.

I am trying to indentify Bots on Mixcloud - so i can delete them from my profile. 
But this will be long term development - this project should be the beginning of it. 

This project uses the jQuery Mobile Framework. The view is not really optimized for small displays but it should be working on all smartphones.
